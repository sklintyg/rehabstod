     * using PingForConfiguration due to NTjP addressing issues, among things.
     *
     * Therefore, we try to issue a SOAP request for itintegration:monitoring:PingForConfiguration for a given
     * logicalAddress.
     * We'll typically get some kind of error back, but the fact that we ARE getting a structured error back means that
     * our connection to NTjP is working properly.
     *
     * Therefore - a SOAPFaultException whose message starts with the known
     * {@link PingForConfigurationServiceBean#NO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS_ERR_PREFIX} means that the NTjP ping is working OK.
     *
     * In the future, NTjP and service producers will hopefully implement proper PingForConfiguration services where
     * we can query them by their logicalAddresses. Until then, this "hack" will have to suffice. *
